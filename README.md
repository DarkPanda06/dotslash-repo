Skindom

Skindom is a revolutionary platform created with the intention to bridge the gap in medical knowledge for the common man. By leveraging advanced image recognition technology fuelled by deep learning, it provides concise, and easy-to-understand explanations of skin conditions, identified through a simple picture upload. Skindom also offers personalized insights into probable causes and subsequently provides recommendations, whether dietary adjustments, skincare tips, or medical intervention. To ensure accuracy and reliability, the platform incorporates feedback and expertise from dermatologists, patients, and researchers.

Problem Scenarios: 

1. Rohan, a 14-year-old, noticed a new set of acne forming on his forehead. Having dealt with bacterial acne in the past, caused by hormonal changes, he managed it by cutting sugar from his food intake. However, the acne worsened this time and he was unsure of what to do. Additionally, he didn’t think a visit to the dermatologist was necessary. What Rohan didn’t realize was that his acne was actually fungal, triggered by an antibiotic course he had taken the week before. Had he used Skindom, a simple photo could have quickly distinguished this from his usual bacterial acne, guiding him to the right solution: reducing oily foods.


2. Sanya, a 46-year-old woman, notices a new mole on her back that has recently become larger, darker, and more irregular in shape. Despite her concern, she isn’t sure whether it’s simply a benign mole or something more serious. She spends hours researching online, but the information is overwhelming and conflicting. Like Rohan, she feels uncertain and believes that and a visit to the dermatologist seems daunting due to time and financial constraints. What Sanya doesn't know is that the mole could be a sign of skin cancer, but without proper guidance, she risks delaying crucial treatment. Early diagnosis is very important in treating serious diseases like cancer. If she had access to Skindom, a simple picture of the mole could have quickly identified the condition, explained the risks, and directed her to seek professional care promptly.
   
Solution with Skindom:

1. Visual & Textual Explanation: Rohan uploads a picture of his acne to the Skindom platform. The deep learning AI scans the image and identifies the type of acne, providing an easy-to-understand explanation about the condition, including its likely cause (in this case, fungal acne triggered by an antibiotic course). The platform generates a detailed report, highlighting the possible triggers, severity, and recommended steps for treatment.


2. Rating Medical Explanations: Once Rohan has reviewed his personalized report, he provides feedback on its clarity, usefulness, and accuracy. His rating helps the platform continually refine its algorithms, ensuring that future explanations are even more helpful and tailored to individual users.

3. Bridging Patients and Clinicians:
Armed with a clearer understanding of his skin condition, Rohan can now engage in a more informed discussion with his healthcare provider. Clinicians, in turn, can use Skindom as a tool to explain complex skin issues to patients more effectively, enhancing communication and ensuring that patients take the right steps toward treatment.

4. Impact:
Skindom helps bridge the gap between patients and clinicians, fostering better communication, enhancing health literacy, and promoting timely and appropriate treatment. It empowers users to take control of their skin health, while also offering a community-driven resource that improves over time, benefiting both individuals and the broader public.
